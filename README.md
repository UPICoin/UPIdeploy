<h4>
AIM</h4>
UPI ( Unit Payment International ) works primarily on 3 platforms 
which include loan, exchange and shopping platforms on the ethereum 
blockchain. All these bases form an ecosystem where users have all the 
features that one other company (base) cannot provide to its users. Our 
goal is to launch 2 platforms in 2019 which include a loan platform 
(providing loans with easy terms to users) and exchanges (which provide 
value added for every transaction at low cost) The shopping platform 
will be launched in mid 2019 where all UPI users can buy and sell items 
such as on eBay and Amazon on the exchange for UPI and other large 
cryptocurrency<br />
